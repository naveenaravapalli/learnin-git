/* git setup */

git config --global user.name "naveen"
git config --global user.email "naveenaravapalli09@gmail.com"
git config --global colour.ui auto
git config -l //to know info--


/* git init */  /* --only for new projects we use this step */

//create directory.
//open the directory using terminal.
//now we need to Initialized Git repository.

git init . //it will create .git floder (hidden one)


/* git add */

//create some files

git status //to see satus
git add <filename> //to add the files
git rm --cached <file name> //to remove file
git add . //it add all files in current dir.
git add -A // it will add all files if you are in another dir in same dir


/* git commits */

git commit -m "any mesage type here"

//to see changes
git log 
//copy commit hash(random numbers)
git show <past hash here> //will see the changes
git diff //give the diffrences current one and commited one
git diff --staged // to give diff of staged files
//if any changes done will see the changes and will follow the git add and git commit steps
git restore <file name>// to discard the changes

git commit --amend -m "messagfe type here" //(--amend)it will replace previous message


/* push an existing repository from the command line */

git remote add origin git@github.com:naveenaravapalli/learnin-git.git //to connect my git repo
git branch -M main //for changing branch master to main
git push -u origin main 
//here we get error we first setup ssh our github account

/* generate ssh key */

//goto git hub profile select SSH and GPG keys and follow the instructions to generate SSH keys link. there you follow commands based on your machine(windows/linux/mac).
//here i am giving link for ssh key generation 

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

//after ssh key generation successfully then try to push the code.
git push -u origin main //for next time you can use only git push

//now you can see local files in oyur github account


/* git pull */

// you will get files and changes from git to your local machine 
git pull //


/* Branches */

//here we have so many commits for each commit it will generate hash(random nunbers (will see using git log command)) all these commits are inside what we called branch.
//while pushing files into git will see the main branch and in internet master branch we changed master to main branch(git branch -M main) both same same. these are default branches.
// A branch represents an independent line of development.
// best pratice was create seperate branch then do copule commits and merge to main branch.


/* working with branches */

git branch //to know working branch
git branch -r //for remote branches
git branch -a //all branches
git branch <new branch name> //to create new branch
git checkout <branch name> //to swithch the branch
git checkout -b <branch name> // at a time create branch and switching to newly created branch
git branch -d <branch name> // to delete the branch(you should not at delete branch to detele)
//newly created branch files will not reflect to main
// for that we need to merge the branches 
git merge <branch  name> //we should at main branch then merge the branch to main after we can delete
git branch -d <branch name> //to delete afetr merge
// Better do pull request in git hub
// for that select pull request option on git hub then select pull request then pic the branch give the discription for changes and pull request.
//we have reviewers to pic them to reviwe the changes. Like some setting are there you can set according to work.
// afetr review click merge pull request. we can configure through settings.
//after delete the branch. 
// now goto main branch you will see the merged branch files.
// goto local machine you can see the changes 
//first we full 
git pull
git log --oneline //to see the changes better way


/* Dealing with conflicts */

//if you avoid conflicts every time you first pull then do the changes then push.
// if in case conflicts are rasied you first slove then then push.
// you can do manually or using using terminal.



/* git rebase */
// if you working on one branch and you master done changes so we need to take that changes and add our changes on top of it this is what rebase allow to do.

git pull --rebase origin main // or use this command git pull -r origin main

//you will see conflicts you should reslove. at a time you can slove one conflict so follow below commands and slove all conflicts.
git add .
git rebase --contiue
// after sloving the conflicts you should push by forcefully
git push -f 
// now you can see the main branch chanegs to your branch then you can merge by the pull rdequest. after you can delete branch.
